        <p>The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.
            The history of all previous societies has been the history of class struggles.
            Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please.
            There is a specter haunting Europe, the specter of Communism.
            History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.
            Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains.
            Last words are for fools who haven't said enough.
            Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people.
            The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people.
